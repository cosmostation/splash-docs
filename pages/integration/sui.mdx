# Splash Wallet integration for SUI

This page describes common uses of the Splash Wallet interface.

## Wallet Standard

**Splash Wallet** and **Cosmostation Extension** implement Sui Wallet Standard, so if you are using [SUI Wallet Standard](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/wallet-adapter/wallet-standard) and [SUI Wallet Kit](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/sdk/wallet-adapter/wallet-kit), they are automatically connected.

```js
implemented features: ["sui:signTransactionBlock", "sui:signAndExecuteTransactionBlock"]
```
